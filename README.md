## Description

Gallery is a personal gallery application that I display my photos for others to see. It has a simple design where a user gets to see all my photos in my homepage. I have included a search field where one can search all photos in a particular category of photos. Say my photo gallery contains pictures of games, one can search for all games out of all photos in the gallery. Another cool feature is the ability to click on a photo and get to see a larger image of it with details about it. Oh, and you can get to copy its url if you liked it that much.

### User Stories

1. A user can view different photos that interest him/her.
2. A user can click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo.
3. A user can search for different categories of photos. (ie. Nature, Food)
4. A user can copy a link to the photo to share with my friends.
5. A user can view photos based on the location they were taken.
